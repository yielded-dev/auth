Consolidate password, email, and session authentication on `Auth.make` and the strategy modules, and remove the superseded workflows, HTTP/RPC integration, OAuth linking service, and store adapters. Replace Cloudflare OTP delivery with `layerEmailProofDelivery` for the shared proof engine.

BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Replace `PasswordAuth`, `EmailOtp`, `AuthSession`, `Workflows`, `HttpServer`, and their support services with the current strategies, `Sessions`, `Http`, and `AuthPersistence`; use `OAuth.makeAccounts` / `OAuth.makeConnected` for provider linking and access. Retired challenge, registration, OAuth-state records, and session cookies are incompatible; reset only that development state and reauthenticate, and explicitly import application identities and credentials if keeping existing accounts.
