Add reusable Effect crypto, Schema-typed JOSE, and OAuth/OIDC packages, and adopt them throughout Auth without changing stored credential formats. Remove unnecessary signing-service requirements from GitHub and use scoped HMAC keys for sessions and numeric proofs.

BEHAVIOR CHANGE: Replace the former crypto/OpenID adapter imports with Auth's direct service Layers and `OpenIdConnect`/`GitHub` modules, supplying crypto and HTTP services explicitly. Implement scoped `Hmac.importKey` in custom backends, replace Auth `SubtleCrypto` overrides with `Hmac` Layers, and keep direct session/numeric-proof crypto constructors in an open Scope. Set managed storage's `prefix`, pass Effect Crypto to `Adapter.makeStorageMappings`, and wrap application-owned Durable Object Drizzle databases with `SqliteDo.makeDatabase` for asynchronous transactions.
