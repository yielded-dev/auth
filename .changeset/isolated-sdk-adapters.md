Move SimpleWebAuthn, OpenID Client, GitHub, and Cloudflare integrations into companion packages, removing their SDK dependencies from core. BEHAVIOR CHANGE: import them from `@yielded/auth-simplewebauthn/Browser` or `/Server` (using `make` and `layer`), `@yielded/auth-openid-client` or its `/Connected` and `/GitHub` entries, and `@yielded/auth-cloudflare`.
