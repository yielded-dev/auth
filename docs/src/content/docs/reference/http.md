title: HTTP and action contracts
description: Route defaults, cookies, request policy, and explicit action declarations.
---

Start with [HTTP integration](../guide/http-and-client) to compose the server,
and the [Effect Atom client](../guide/client) to call it. Both use the same
`AuthContract`; this page covers the transport details and custom actions.

## Route defaults

| Actions                             | HTTP method | Default path                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `getSession`, `requireSession`      | GET         | `/auth/getSession`, `/auth/requireSession`            |
| `getSessionFresh`                   | GET         | `/auth/getSessionFresh`                               |
| `signIn`, `signOut`, `renewSession` | POST        | `/auth/signIn`, `/auth/signOut`, `/auth/renewSession` |

No-input queries use GET. Queries with payloads use POST so their inputs stay out
of URLs. Change the shared prefix with `basePath` on `AuthContract.make`; server
and client use the same descriptors.

The HttpApi group defaults to `auth`. To rename it, use the same name in the
shared contract and server handlers:

```ts
// Shared API
AuthContract.httpGroup(AuthApi, { name: "account" });

// Server Layer
http.handlers(Api, { name: "account" });
```

Configure paths through `basePath` rather than prefixing the generated endpoints.

`getSessionFresh` always bypasses the session cookie cache. Sending
`x-effect-auth-session-fresh: 1` also forces fresh verification for ordinary
request-aware session reads, including `getSession` and `requireSession`.
Allow that header in application-owned CORS configuration; the lower-level
operation transport admits it in preflights. Fresh verification still follows
the [backend's consistency guarantee](./adapters#key-value-session-authority).

## Cookies and request policy

Cookies default to `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, path `/`, and the
`__Host-effect-auth-` prefix. Override `cookie.name` for the session slot or
`cookie.prefix` for all slots. Secure custom names and prefixes must begin with
`__Host-` without a cookie domain. `cookie.secure: false` is
allowed only with HTTP loopback origins (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `[::1]`).
Use your real HTTPS origin; never derive trusted origins from an untrusted request
header. Invalid combinations fail startup.

OAuth callbacks need the request-binding cookie on a cross-site return. Keep
`SameSite=Lax`; configuring OAuth with `cookie.sameSite: "strict"` fails startup.

`cookie.domain` shares every auth cookie with a bare host and its subdomains
(no scheme, port, path, or leading dot). It requires HTTPS, `Secure`, and
`__Secure-` names; the default prefix becomes `__Secure-effect-auth-`.
`__Host-` names fail startup with `OperationHttpConfigurationError`.

`trustedOrigins` adds exact HTTPS origins alongside `origin` for request admission
and default OAuth redirects. With a cookie domain, all origins must be inside it.
Wildcards and URL paths are rejected; ports must match. Configure credentialed
CORS separately for cross-origin fetches.

Use domain cookies only when you trust every subdomain to receive and set them.
See [shared-session setup and security](../guide/http-and-client#sharing-sessions-across-apps).

POST auth actions require an admitted Origin, JSON content type, and
`x-effect-auth-csrf: 1` by default. GET actions have no body or CSRF header and
reject an explicitly untrusted Origin. Duplicate credential cookies are rejected,
and session responses are not cacheable. If you override `csrf` on the server,
pass matching settings to `Client.make`.

With `Sessions.stateful({ cacheFor })` or `Sessions.stateAssisted({ cacheFor })`,
the additional `session-cache` cookie holds a signed public session snapshot.
It follows the same cookie security policy. Caching is disabled by default;
`maximumTokenBytes` defaults to `4096`. Cache hits need no server storage lookup.
The snapshot is bound to its session credential, and invalid or expired snapshots
fall back to authoritative verification. Oversized or unencodable snapshots are
cleared instead of issued, leaving authoritative reads available.

Auth mutations bypass and clear the snapshot. Issuing, renewing, or clearing a
session credential clears it too; sign-out clears both cookies in this browser.
Other clients can retain a snapshot until `cacheFor` expires, delaying visibility
of revocation, password changes, disablement, and authoritative claim changes.
See [session cache policy](../guide/sessions#cache-ordinary-session-reads).

Named mutations enforce Origin and CSRF before side effects, including local
calls from application routes. Raw strategy methods are treated as mutations.
For a custom credential-producing workflow, call `http.protect(effect)` inside
the request boundary; it applies mutation policy and supplies private collectors
without imposing a body format. Custom hosts still own webhook validation and
ordinary application mutation policy.

## Proof request rate limits

Auth supplies `Proofs.HostIngressLimiter` for email code/link and password-reset
requests. The default network bucket holds twenty requests and replenishes one
every three minutes, shared across purposes and device keys. Every request is
checked before target lookup, including retries and suppressed requests.
Durable delivery quotas separately count only issued proofs.

Configure the bucket when building Auth:

```ts
import { Proofs } from "@yielded/auth";
import { Layer } from "effect";

const AuthLive = AppAuth.layer.pipe(
  Layer.provide(Proofs.HostIngressLimiter.layer({ limit: 40, windowMillis: 3_600_000 })),
);
```

Both options must be positive integers. The default store is process-local, resets
when it is recreated, and holds at most 10,000 network keys. At capacity it evicts the
least recently checked key, which later starts with a full bucket. For
shared enforcement across servers, provide the application-wide
[root storage Layer](../guide/storage#shared-key-value-storage) to Auth. Its
`RateLimiterStore` also serves password limits; keep one Redis connection and
storage provider for these features.
An explicitly provided `RateLimiter` or `HostIngressLimiter` also replaces its
default. Limit malformed traffic at the host before HTTP/RPC parsing.

`Http.layer`, generated routes, and `http.middleware` derive
`Proofs.ProofRequestContext` from the current socket peer. They ignore `Forwarded`
and `X-Forwarded-For`. For a trusted proxy or a host without socket metadata,
provide the verified client identity around each request:

```ts
handler.pipe(
  Effect.provideService(
    Proofs.ProofRequestContext,
    Effect.succeed({ networkKey: Redacted.make(trustedClientAddress) }),
  ),
);
```

The resolver runs only when an operation needs proof admission. Without a peer or
override, code/reset requests fail as unavailable; unrelated routes still work.
Never derive this identity from operation payloads or install one caller in a
shared Auth Layer. Raw `OperationHttpServer.handle` and non-HTTP calls require
this per-invocation service explicitly.

## Declare an action

The method guides show the available local strategy calls. Browser access requires
an action in `AuthApi`: `AuthContract.passwordSignIn` is the password shortcut;
`AuthContract.fromOperation` reuses a pure operation contract; `AuthContract.action`
accepts explicit payload, success, and error schemas.

Each action selects a server `method` and, when needed, a `strategy`. The method
defaults to the action's name. You can expose two strategies under different names
without making the client choose a strategy string. Configure only actions your
application intends to serve. Passkey and TOTP have dedicated pure contract modules;
the email, phone, and OAuth flows currently require explicit action schemas.

Map private method inputs through `requestFields` when declaring an action:

| Method input                                                         | Credential slot      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Email, phone, or OAuth `requestBinding`; passkey `bindingCredential` | `request-binding`    |
| Email continuation `credential`                                      | `proof-continuation` |
| TOTP `pendingCredential`                                             | `pending-proof`      |

The server injects those values from `Auth.AuthRequest`; both named local calls and
remote payloads omit them. Set `credentials: true` for actions that issue or clear
credentials, declare any private reveals, and supply a `subject.fromSuccess`
projection for actions that establish or replace the authenticated account.
`fromOperation` carries forward the operation's schemas, replay policy, credential
delivery, and reveal declarations; the subject projection remains explicit.

See the [passkey contract](../guide/passkeys#define-the-shared-actions) for a complete
example and [TOTP](../guide/totp#expose-private-reveals-over-http) for private reveals.

## Lower-level transports

`http.withRequest` wraps a custom Effect returning `HttpServerResponse`.
`http.operationLayer` supplies browser policy and caller resolution to existing
`OperationHttpServer` contracts. Those descriptors continue to own private payload
injection and explicitly selected reveals.
Encode expected response failures before leaving the request wrapper.

`OperationHttpServer.make` retains configuration and caller resolution. Supply
operation handlers, codec services, and callback response services when running
`server.handle(request)`. Shared `Http` routes bind their auth API and expose other
invocation services as `HttpRouter.Request` requirements for host middleware.
Keep trusted caller context in that middleware; never install one caller in a
shared application Layer. See the
[lower-level server example](https://github.com/yielded-dev/auth/blob/main/examples/auth/src/transport-application.ts).

`OperationHttpClient.make` requires the same Effect `HttpClient` service.
`OperationHttpClient.layer(options)` provides `OperationHttpClient.Client` for
consumers such as `AuthAtom.makeLifetime({ initialSubject })`. Supply this Layer
at the application boundary and keep the lifetime's Scope open until the host
finishes. The lifetime acquires its transport from the service environment.
`AuthAtom.query`, `AuthAtom.mutation`, and `AuthAtom.workflow` remain available for
custom integration. Private reveals belong in a finite
collector, outside ordinary query caches, logs, and persisted client state.
