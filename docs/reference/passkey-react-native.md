# iOS passkey adapter

Import `* as ReactNativePasskey` from `@yielded/auth-react-native` in the native
entrypoint only. `ReactNativePasskey.make()` returns an Effect of the service
implementation; `ReactNativePasskey.layer` provides the `PasskeyReactNative` service.
Construction performs no native I/O. Each ceremony owns an internal Effect Scope.

| Member                                 | Input                                                           | Effect success                     |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `capabilities`                         | None                                                            | `PasskeyReactNativeCapabilities`   |
| `register(started)`                    | `PasskeyRegistrationStarted`                                    | `PasskeyReactNativeRegistration`   |
| `authenticate({ started, mediation })` | `PasskeyAuthenticationStarted`, `"required"` or `"conditional"` | `PasskeyReactNativeAuthentication` |

Registration uses platform passkeys with `attestation: "none"`; `pubKeyCredParams`
must include ES256 (`alg: -7`). A request without ES256 fails before opening a
native prompt. Security-key registration is unsupported; authentication can use
existing platform or security-key credentials.

Registration and authentication return the original `flowId` and a redacted JSON
`response` for the server's Complete call. Inputs are snapshotted and validated;
native output is schema-decoded with bounded canonical base64url fields and
matching credential IDs. Missing assertion `rawId` is filled from `id`; missing
`type` becomes `"public-key"`. Unrequested extension results are discarded. The
adapter does not verify signatures or replace server validation.

## Capabilities and lifecycle

`capabilities.supported` checks OS support, not native linking, associated domains,
key availability, or account configuration. `conditionalGet` and `cancellation`
are always `"unsupported"`. Interruption stops the Effect and discards a late
response, but **cannot dismiss the system prompt**. Timeouts have the same limit.
Every adapter instance in one installed module shares a busy guard until the native
promise settles. If it never settles, the guard stays busy for that JS runtime.
Use one installed copy and route all ceremonies through it; direct peer calls
cannot participate in the guard.

| Failure                             | Meaning                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PasskeyReactNativeInputRejected`   | Invalid or expired input.                                                                                                |
| `PasskeyReactNativeUnsupported`     | Unsupported OS, mediation, or registration algorithms; exclusions unavailable on this iOS version.                       |
| `PasskeyReactNativeBusy`            | Another native request has not settled.                                                                                  |
| `PasskeyReactNativeNotCompleted`    | Sanitized `reason`: `cancelled`, `no-credentials`, `credential-exists`, `interrupted`, `timed-out`, or `request-failed`. |
| `PasskeyReactNativeInvalidResponse` | Malformed, oversized, or inconsistent native credential JSON.                                                            |
| `PasskeyReactNativeUnavailable`     | Configuration, linking, unexpected native failure, or defect.                                                            |

Effect interruption stays interruption; it is not converted into a typed native
cancellation. No failure proves that registration created no credential. The adapter
does not retry or complete a server flow after interruption. Preserve the server's
single-use/recovery policy and do not automatically repeat credential creation.
Errors contain no credentials, native messages, or native causes; unwrap the response
only at your protected transport boundary and keep it out of telemetry.

Unexpected native/configuration failures and defects produce one content-free
`reportAuthFailure` diagnostic at the `passkey-react-native` stage before redaction.
Expected rejection, cancellation, and schema validation failures do not produce
infrastructure diagnostics. The calling fiber owns reporting. After interruption,
late native callbacks only release the busy guard and discard the outcome; they
do not inspect it, retain a scoped logger, or launch detached reporting work.

Ceremonies reject expired started values and time out at the earlier of
`expiresAtMillis` or the start time plus `options.timeout` (1–300,000 ms).
`capabilities` can fail with `PasskeyReactNativeUnavailable`; ceremony failures
are the `PasskeyReactNativeFailure` union. All asynchronous operations return
Effects, with no additional service requirement after construction.

See [iOS setup](../guide/passkeys#prompt-in-an-ios-react-native-app) for peer
installation, runtime prerequisites, associated domains, and signed-device proof.
