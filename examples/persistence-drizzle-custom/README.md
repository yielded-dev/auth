# Drizzle with application-owned schema and migrations

The account app from the managed example, with application-declared Drizzle tables
and Drizzle Kit migrations. It supports registration, Cloudflare email verification,
password recovery, and adding and signing in with passkeys.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM` defaults to `hello@effect-agent.com`.

```sh
vp -C examples/persistence-drizzle-custom run start
```

Open http://localhost:4182 and create an account. Each example has its own database;
this one's accounts, sessions, proofs, and passkeys persist in `.data/auth.sqlite`.
Private proof and request-binding keys persist in `.data/keys.json`.

[tables.ts](src/tables.ts) and [passkey-tables.ts](src/passkey-tables.ts) declare the
application's physical tables and columns. [schema.ts](src/schema.ts) connects them
with `Persistence.map({ subjects, tables })`. [Drizzle Kit](drizzle.config.ts) generates
SQL and snapshots from those declarations into [drizzle](drizzle). After changing a
table, generate a migration, then review and commit it:

```sh
vp -C examples/persistence-drizzle-custom run db:generate --name=describe_change
```

Generation compacts JSON snapshots to one line; Git marks them as generated.

[MigrationsLive](src/migrations.ts) applies the generated files with Drizzle and records
them in `__drizzle_migrations`. Run `vp -C examples/persistence-drizzle-custom run db:migrate`
to apply them separately. [live.ts](src/live.ts) also runs them before providing persistence;
startup never generates or pushes schema changes:

```ts
const DatabaseReady = MigrationsLive.pipe(Layer.provideMerge(Persistence.Config.layer(storage)));
```

The library supplies transactional auth operations. The application supplies customer
IDs, policy, claims, delivery, and custom hashing. Email confirmation and passkey
enrollment preserve the existing session. Use `localhost:4182` consistently for passkeys.

`AUTH_DATA_DIR` selects another data directory. Removing this example's `.data`
resets only its accounts, sessions, credentials, and keys.

All three SQL examples import the same [AuthApi](../shared/account/contract.ts),
[AppAuth](../shared/account/auth.ts), and [client](../shared/account/email-client.ts).
This app's [live.ts](src/live.ts) supplies its persistence and account Layers.
Hashing, Cloudflare delivery, forms, and Atom workflows also live in
[shared/account](../shared/account).
