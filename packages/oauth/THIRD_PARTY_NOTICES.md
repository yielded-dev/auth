# Third-party notices

Selected OAuth/OIDC contracts were adapted into Effect tests from the pinned
upstream snapshots below. The native runtime uses Effect and owned JOSE, and
includes the attributed form-encoding adaptation below. Neither upstream SDK is
a runtime dependency.

The case mappings identify selected assertions and fixtures for Auth's
authorization-code + S256/RS256 profile. They do not represent complete ports of
the upstream suites. Local case names below are exact; paths are package-relative.

The local `expiresIn` value is the decoded lifetime; the upstream helper's
elapsed-time/countdown implementation is not included.

## oauth4webapi 3.8.8

Version: **3.8.8**. Commit: **`916b97952dbf431d8b72f369840de54f5a286e4d`**.

Runtime adaptation: [src/index.ts, `formUrlEncode`](https://github.com/panva/oauth4webapi/blob/916b97952dbf431d8b72f369840de54f5a286e4d/src/index.ts#L1867),
used by upstream `ClientSecretBasic`, is adapted as
[src/OAuth.ts, `basicComponent`](src/OAuth.ts). It form-encodes each credential
component before joining them with a colon, including escaped punctuation and
`+` for spaces. The MIT license below covers this adaptation as well as the
selected test contracts.

The PKCE verifier/challenge vector in [test/protocol.test.ts](test/protocol.test.ts),
`uses RFC7636 S256 and fresh private 32-byte transaction secrets`, comes from
[RFC7636 Appendix B](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636.html#appendix-B).

Auth supplies the strict single-audience policy, signature-before-rejection
classification, hash bindings, captured authentication time, refresh continuity,
private receipts, no retries and scoped cleanup. Refresh continuity in
`refresh binds subject/optional nonce/auth_time without treating old max_age as a new login`
is an Auth-profile case guided by
[OpenID Connect Core 12.2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RefreshTokenResponse).
The cancellation seam came from this repository's former
`packages/auth-openid-client/test/protocol.test.ts`. Metadata immutability,
bounded JSON and close-active-operation regressions are local cases.
