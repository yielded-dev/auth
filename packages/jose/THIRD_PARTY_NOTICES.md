# Third-party notices

Selected public contract tests and the P-256 fixture in `test/` are adapted from
[panva/jose](https://github.com/panva/jose/tree/505a55b8f73536082367b2614cb77e927ba96ec1),
v6.2.12, commit `505a55b8f73536082367b2614cb77e927ba96ec1` (Filip Skokan).
The selected source contracts are adapted to the supported profile:

Only applicable public behavior is adapted; flattened-format tests supply shared
header and authentication-tag validation, not JSON serialization support. Tests
use independent interoperation against that release, plus Effect-specific
policy capture, scoped cancellation and bounded-waiter regressions. This is not
a full upstream suite port or a claim of full upstream compatibility.

The source implementation informs claim validation, protected-header policy, and
key selection in `src/Jwt.ts`, `src/Jws.ts`, `src/Jwk.ts`, `src/Jwks.ts`, and
`src/Jwe.ts`; these implementations are written for Effect services and Schema.
No panva/jose runtime implementation is bundled or required.

The wire formats follow RFC 7515, RFC 7516, RFC 7517, RFC 7518, RFC 7519,
and RFC 8037; policy follows RFC 8725. No RFC code or example vectors are copied.
Cryptographic primitives are supplied by `@yielded/crypto`, which ships its own notices.
