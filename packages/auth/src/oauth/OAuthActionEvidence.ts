/** Application action authority; no default grants access. Verify the exact
 * challenge and revisions. A one-shot proof is consumed in its own authority.
 * Recent session step-up may be accepted only after matching this invocation to
 * its real private provenance, factor IDs/revisions and original proof times;
 * public assurance ordinals must never be converted into credential IDs. Return
 * Session source with the exact session ID and authenticatedAt. Core also checks
 * both authentication and factor freshness. Link retains this begin authorization
 * and requires no second proof at completion. Pending/registration capabilities
 * do not authorize account changes.
 * Counter consumption need not replace semantic credential revision; replacement,
 * revocation and policy/binding changes must advance the corresponding revisions.
 * A later OAuth CAS rejection does not refund a factor or imply an atomic join.
