 * Identifier removal/rebinding/verification changes that invalidate captured login
 * authority MUST atomically bump subject securityRevision. AuthenticationRevision
 * deliberately has no identifier-binding revision: deleting dependent proofs alone
 * cannot invalidate password evidence already captured before verification.
